## What's new?
### V 1.01

- Switch Axes now take power phial into account. (Because why would you use any other phial type)
- Couple of CSS changes. Site should be very very slightly better looking on mobile.

## To-do
- Make the table update automatically when you change modifiers
- Compare between weapon types
- Compare specific weapons
- Compare weapons against a specific monster
- Gunner stuff maybe?
